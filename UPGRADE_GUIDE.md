## 5.0 Thread-Safe with Client Object

Likelihood of Impact: High

This library is now thread-safe with the introduction of a new `Client` object. Instead of defining a global API key that all requests use, you now create an `Client` object and pass your API key to it with optional open and read timeout params. You then call your desired functions against a `service` which are called against a `Client` object:

```ruby
# Old way
EasyPost.api_key = ENV['EASYPOST_API_KEY']
shipment = EasyPost::Shipment.retrieve('shp_...')

# New way
client = EasyPost::Client.new(api_key: ENV['EASYPOST_TEST_API_KEY'])
shipment = client.shipment.retrieve('shp_...')
```

All instance methods are now static with the exception of `lowest_rate` as these make API calls and require the Client object(EasyPost objects do not contain an API key to make API calls with).

Previously used `.save()` instance methods are now static `.update()` functions where you specify first the ID of the object you are updating and second, the parameters that need updating.

## 5.0 Updated Dependencies

Likelihood of Impact: High

**Ruby 2.6 Required**

easypost-ruby now requires Ruby 2.6 or greater.

**Dependencies**

All dependencies had minor version bumps.

## 5.0 Improved Error Handling

Likelihood of Impact: High

There are ~2 dozen new error types that extend either `ApiError` or `EasyPostError`.

New ApiErrors (extends EasyPostError):

- `ApiError`
- `ConnectionError`
- `ExternalApiError`
- `ForbiddenError`
- `GatewayTimeoutError`
- `InternalServerError`
- `InvalidRequestError`
- `MethodNotAllowedError`
- `NotFoundError`
- `PaymentError`
- `ProxyError`
- `RateLimitError`
- `RedirectError`
- `RetryError`
- `ServiceUnavailableError`
- `SSLError`
- `TimeoutError`
- `UnauthorizedError`
- `UnknownApiError`

New EasyPostErrors (extends builtin Exception):

- `EasyPostError`
- `EndOfPaginationError`
- `FilteringError`
- `InvalidObjectError`
- `InvalidParameterError`
- `MissingParameterError`
- `SignatureVerificationError`

ApiErrors will behave like the previous Error class did. They will include a `message`, `http_status`, and `http_body`. Additionally, a new `code` and `errors` keys are present and populate when available. This class extends the more generic `EasyPostError` which only contains a message, used for errors thrown directly from this library.

## 5.0 Corrected Naming Conventions

Likelihood of Impact: Medium

Occurances of `referral` are now `referral_customer` and `Referral` are now `ReferralCustomer` to match the documentation and API.

Occurances of `smartrate` are now `smart_rate` and `Smartrate` are now `SmartRate` to match the documentation and API.

Occurances of `scanform` are now `scan_form` and `Scanform` are now `ScanForm` to match the documentation and API.

Rename function `get_smartrates` to `get_smart_rates`

Rename function `get_lowest_smartrate` to `get_lowest_smart_rate`

## 5.0 Beta Namespace Changed

Likelihood of Impact: Low

Previously, the beta namespace was found at `easypost.beta.x` where `x` is the name of your model. Now, the beta namespace is simply prepended to the name of your service: `client.beta_x`. for instance, you can call `client.beta_referral_customer.add_payment_method()`.

## 5.0 Return True For Empty API Response

Likelihood of Impact: Low

Empty API response functions for `delete` return `true` instead of empty object

## Upgrading from 3.x to 4.0

**NOTICE:** v4 is deprecated.

### 4.0 High Impact Changes

* [Updating Dependencies](#40-updating-dependencies)

### 4.0 Medium Impact Changes

* [Removal of `get_rates` Shipment Method](#40-removal-of-getrates-shipment-method)

### 4.0 Low Impact Changes

* [Removal of `Print` and `PrintJob` Objects](#40-removal-of-print-and-printjob-objects)
* [Removal of `stamp_and_barcode_by_reference` Batch Method](#40-removal-of-stampandbarcodebyreference-batch-method)
* [Removal of `Address.verify` Parameters](#40-removal-of-addressverify-parameters)
* [Removal of the `http_status` Property on EasyPost::Error](#40-removal-of-httpstatus-property-on-easyposterror)

## 4.0 Updating Dependencies

Likelihood of Impact: High

**Ruby 2.5 Required**

easypost-ruby now requires Ruby 2.5 or greater.

**Dependencies**

No production dependencies were altered. Development dependencies were all bumped and `simplecov` and `rubocop` were introduced.

## 4.0 Removal of get_rates Shipment Method

Likelihood of Impact: Medium

The HTTP method used for the `get_rates` endpoint at the API level has changed from `POST` to `GET` and will only retrieve rates for a shipment instead of regenerating them. A new `/rerate` endpoint has been introduced to replace this functionality; In this library, you can now call the `Shipment.regenerate_rates` method to regenerate rates. Due to the logic change, the `get_rates` method has been removed since a Shipment inherently already has rates associated.

## 4.0 Removal of Print and PrintJob Objects

Likelihood of Impact: Low

The `Print` and `PrintJob` objects have been removed as they are no longer usable with the current version of the API.

## 4.0 Removal of stamp_and_barcode_by_reference Batch Method

Likelihood of Impact: Low

The `stamp_and_barcode_by_reference` Batch method has been removed as it is no longer usable with the current version of the API.

## 4.0 Removal of Address.verify Parameters

Likelihood of Impact: Low

The parameters for the `Address.verify` method were removed as they were unusable, the current version of the API does not allow you to verify an address by specifying a carrier.

## 4.0 Removal of http_status Property on EasyPost::Error

Likelihood of Impact: Low

The deprecated `http_status` property has been removed in favor of the `status` property on the EasyPost::Error object.
